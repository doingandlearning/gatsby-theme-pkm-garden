## Blog/Digital Garden

This started off as a Lumen clone but has gradually morphed into sometime more
bespoke. I'm gradually swapping out the original CSS for Tailwind and I'm working
on a wiki implementation.

This is mainly for development of the `gatsby-theme-pkm-garden`.

To work locally run:

```
yarn
yarn workspace www develop
```
